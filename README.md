# A list of resources

This is an opinionated collection of resources and links for modern scientific computing. At the very least, these are things that me and my team use on a regular basis in our work. This topic comes up at tutorials and courses, so I wanted to consolidate it all in one place.

There are plenty of things not in this list only because we don't use them that much. If you have suggestions as to what to add, please submit a PR!
